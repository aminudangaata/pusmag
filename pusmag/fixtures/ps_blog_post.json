By making contributions and donations, individuals can support the important work of the Association and help to ensure its continued success. We will discuss why contributions and donations to the Association are so important, and what impact they can have.</p><p>One of the main reasons for making contributions and donations to PSMAG is to help support its mission. The Association seeks to promote the developmental, religious, social and general welfare of all Muslim Public Servants in Ghana. By making contributions and donations, individuals can help to ensure that these goals are achieved and that the Association can continue to do important work.</p><p>Furthermore, making contributions and donations is to demonstrate a commitment to the community. By making a financial commitment to the Association, individuals can show their support for the work that the Association does and the impact it has. This not only helps to sustain the Association, but it also sends a message of unity and support to other members of the Muslim community.</p><p>The Qur’an and Hadiths also emphasize the importance of giving and supporting good causes. In Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 254, the Qur’an states, <strong>“And spend from what We have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says, ‘My Lord, if only You would delay me for a brief term so I would give charity and be among the righteous.'”</strong> This verse throws light on the idea that giving and supporting good causes is a critical aspect of the Islam. Additionally, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said in a Hadith, <strong>“The best form of charity is to give while one is still alive.”</strong> This Hadith emphasises the idea that giving and supporting good causes is a way of making a positive impact on humanity and ensuring a better future for all.</p><p>Contributions and donations to the Association play a crucial role in ensuring its success and making a positive impact on the Muslim community. By making a financial commitment, we can support the important work of the Association, demonstrate our commitment to the community. So, let us give generously to the Association and help ensure its continued success.</p></div>",

  "post_content": "<div class=\"ql-editor read-mode\"><p>Muslims who serve in public positions play an important role in shaping the future of our communities and countries. We have the opportunity to make a positive impact and to serve as role models for other Muslims. However, the challenges faced by Muslim Public Servants can be unique and overwhelming, making it imperative that they come together and form a united front. In this post, we will discuss the need for an Association and why it is important for Muslims in the Public Service to have one.</p><p>One of the main reasons for forming an Association is to provide a supportive network for its members. Muslim Public Servants can face discrimination and prejudice, making it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. By coming together and forming an Association, Muslim Public Servants can provide each other with a sense of comfort and support, making it easier to navigate the challenges they face.</p><p>Another reason for forming an Association is to promote diversity and representation in the public sector. Muslims can bring a unique perspective and diverse set of skills to the table, and by having a strong representation in Public Service, we can help to shape policies and decision-making processes in a way that benefits everyone.</p><p>The Qur’an and Hadiths also emphasize the importance of unity and support in the community. In Surah Al-Anfal, verse 72, the Qur’an states,&nbsp;“<strong>And those who believed and emigrated and strove with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah and those who gave shelter and aided – they are allies of one another.</strong>”&nbsp;This verse highlights the idea that Muslims should work together and support each other in their endeavours. Additionally, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said in a Hadith,&nbsp;“<strong>The hand of Allah is with the community.</strong>”&nbsp;This Hadith emphasises the idea that when Muslims come together and work as a united community, they can achieve great things.</p><p>In conclusion, the need for an Association of Muslim Public Servants cannot be overstated. By coming together and forming a united front, we can provide each other with support, promote diversity and representation in the public sector, and make a positive impact on Ghana our dear country.</p><p>The Qur’an and Hadiths also emphasise the importance of unity and support in the community, making it clear that this is a critical step for Muslims who serve in public positions. So, let us take the initiative to ensure the Association has come to stay and work together to make a difference in our communities and the entire country.</p></div>",

  "post_content": "<div class=\"ql-editor read-mode\"><p>Brotherhood is a fundamental aspect of the Islamic faith and is deeply rooted in the teachings of the Qur’an and Hadiths. The bond between Muslim brothers and sisters is not just a matter of shared religion, but it also encompasses love, compassion, and mutual support. In this blog post, we will explore the importance of maintaining a strong brotherhood and how it can enrich our lives both spiritually and socially.</p><p>One of the key verses in the Qur’an that highlights the importance of brotherhood is <strong>Surah Al-Hujurat, verse 10</strong>, which states, <strong>“The believers are but brothers, so make peace between your brothers.”</strong> This verse emphasizes the fact that all Muslims are siblings in faith and therefore, should strive to maintain peace and harmony among one another. Moreover, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also said in a Hadith, <strong>“A Muslim is the brother of another Muslim; he should not oppress him, nor should he abandon him.”</strong> This Hadith underscores the responsibility that every Muslim has to support and care for their brothers and sisters in faith.</p><p>Another important aspect of brotherhood in Islam is the idea of mutual support. The Qur’an encourages Muslims to support one another and to help each other in times of need. This can be seen in Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 177, which states, <strong>“It is not righteousness that you turn your faces toward the East or the West, but righteousness is to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers, to spend of your wealth, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the traveler, for those who ask, and for freeing slaves, to establish prayer and to give Zakat; to fulfill your promises when you make them, and to be patient in poverty and hardship and during battle.”</strong> This verse highlights the importance of caring for one another and supporting one another in times of need.</p><p>In addition to the Qur’anic verses, there are numerous Hadiths that emphasize the importance of brotherhood in Islam. For example, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, <strong>“The best of companions is he who is best to his companion, and the best of neighbors is he who is best to his neighbor.”</strong> This Hadith highlights the idea that a true Muslim should always strive to be a good companion and a good neighbor to others.</p><p>In conclusion, brotherhood is a critical aspect of the Islamic faith that provides a foundation of love, support, and compassion. By following the teachings of the Qur’an and Hadiths, we can cultivate strong bonds with our brothers and sisters in faith and build a community that is united, supportive, and enriching. By nurturing these bonds, we can experience the true essence of Islam and live a life that is filled with love, happiness, and spiritual fulfillment.</p></div>",

  "post_category": "Ramadan",
  "post_content": "<div class=\"ql-editor read-mode\"><p>Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is a time of spiritual reflection, self-discipline, and increased worship for Muslims around the world. Ramadan is one of the most significant and anticipated months in the Islamic calendar. It is a time for Muslims to come together in solidarity and engage in spiritual reflection, self-discipline, and charitable acts. The month is dedicated to fasting from sunrise to sunset and engaging in acts of worship and devotion to Allah.</p><p>The Qur’an has much to say about the importance of Ramadan and the act of fasting. In Surah Al-Baqarah verse 183, Allah says:&nbsp;“O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you, that you may become righteous”. This verse highlights the importance of fasting as a means of attaining righteousness and drawing closer to Allah.</p><p>Ramadan is a time for purifying the soul and reconnecting with Allah. Muslims use this time to focus on their relationship with Allah, to increase their devotion, and to seek forgiveness for any wrongdoings. Fasting is seen as a means of spiritual purification and is considered one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><p>The Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said in an authentic hadith that “Fasting is a shield, so the person observing fast should avoid sexual relation with his wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently, and if somebody fights with him or abuses him, he should tell him twice, ‘I am fasting.'” (Bukhari, Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 31, Number 128).</p><p>In another narration, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Fasting is not just abstaining from food and drink, but also from vain and obscene speech.” (Bukhari, Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 31, Number 120)</p><p>The act of fasting involves abstaining from food, drink, and other physical desires from dawn until sunset. This is a form of self-discipline and a means of practicing patience and perseverance. The fast is broken at sunset with a meal known as “iftar” and it is customary for families to gather for this meal, to break bread together and to share in each other’s company.</p><p>In addition to fasting, Ramadan is a time for increased worship and devotion. Muslims engage in special prayers, known as Tarawih, during the evenings and spend more time reading and studying the Qur’an. The month is also a time for increased charity, as Muslims are encouraged to donate to those in need and to engage in acts of kindness and compassion.</p><p>Ramadan is a time for coming together as a community, to support and encourage each other, and to strengthen relationships. It is a time for reflection, self-improvement, and spiritual growth. For many Muslims, Ramadan is the highlight of their year, a time when they feel closest to Allah and to their fellow believers.</p><p>The famous poet Rumi writes: “Fasting is not about hunger, it’s about freeing yourself from the slavery of your desires”. This line captures the essence of Ramadan, as a time for purifying the soul and breaking free from the shackles of material desires.</p><p>Another famous Arabic poet, Al-Mutanabbi, writes: “Fasting is a shield, it will protect you from the fire of Hell”. This line highlights the protective and purifying nature of Ramadan and the act of fasting.</p><p>In addition to fasting, Ramadan is a time for increased worship and devotion. Muslims engage in special prayers, known as Tarawih, during the evenings and spend more time reading and studying the Qur’an. In Surah Al-Kahf verse 9, Allah says:&nbsp;“And the Qur’an is a guidance for the righteous”. This verse highlights the importance of the Qur’an in guiding Muslims towards righteousness and spiritual growth.</p><p>Ramadan is also a time for increased charity and acts of kindness. In Surah Al-Baqarah verse 195, Allah says:&nbsp;“And spend in the way of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction”. This verse highlights the importance of giving to others and engaging in acts of compassion, as a means of attaining Allah’s grace and avoiding destruction.</p><p>One of the most significant aspects of Ramadan is the sense of community it creates. Muslims gather together to break their fast, to attend mosque, and to participate in other activities. This sense of community is crucial for those who may be experiencing difficulties, as Ramadan provides a supportive and nurturing environment for growth and self-discovery.</p><p>Ramadan is a time for self-reflection and introspection. Muslims are encouraged to examine their lives and to seek out areas in which they can improve. This includes not only physical acts, but also thoughts and attitudes, as well as relationships with others.</p><p>Finally, Ramadan is a time of great significance and importance in the Islamic calendar. It is a time for fasting, increased worship, and charity, and provides a supportive environment for self-reflection and spiritual growth. Through the act of fasting and increased worship, Muslims can purify their souls and attain righteousness, guided by the wisdom of Qur’anic verses and the poetry of their faith.</p><p>Oh Allah, as we welcome the blessed month of Ramadan, guide us on the path of righteousness and help us to fast with sincerity and devotion. Fill our hearts with Your love and mercy, and help us to draw closer to You through acts of kindness, charity, and self-reflection. Ameen.</p></div>",
